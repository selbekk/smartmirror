# Smart mirror

Welcome to my personal smart mirror project.

It's a side project I'm making for our household. I'm using Elm on the frontend, and Node on the backend.

## Development

The application is split in two - a Node/TS API and an Elm frontend.

### Backend

To start the backend, follow these steps:

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm install # to install dependencies
$ npm run watch
```

### Frontend

TBD
